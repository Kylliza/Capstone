This are the websites I am use to scrape or try, I am not really moving foward but will open a ticket to finally sit down and get some 1v1 tutoring if posible. 


https://www.pikalytics.com/pokedex/homebsd 
https://www.smogon.com/stats/2023-02/

both of these websites have data for both console (nintendo switch) and pokemon showdown (online fan made battle system with real time battles and official coding of the game but in a web browser (super convinient for ppl with little to no time to invest in team building or just want to hit it on the rode / phone without having to carry your switch.))

Casual and Ranked mode available, different rules also available. 

I will focus on COMPETITIVE VGC 2022-2023 GEN9 as there are dozens of formats in the game right now. I will focus on the official format. Might do just switch as there are thousands (100k+ or even hits the mill+) because if I use showdown it in the millions, too much for me maybe, or maybe is more convenient. We will see.
